### SmartFace IoT Facial Recognition
This project demonstrates the feasibility of building a basic face recognition system using a Raspberry Pi. While offering lower processing power compared to high-end computers, Raspberry Pi provides a cost-effective platform for personal projects and learning about facial recognition technology. Explore opportunities for integrating the facial recognition system with home automation systems, enabling personalized experiences based on recognized individuals.

#### Overview
SmartFace IoT Facial Recognition is a project aimed at implementing a facial recognition system using Raspberry Pi. With the increasing popularity of IoT devices and the accessibility of Raspberry Pi, this project showcases how facial recognition technology can be leveraged on low-power, cost-effective hardware for various applications. By integrating facial recognition with home automation systems, users can create personalized experiences based on recognized individuals, such as automatically adjusting smart home settings or providing tailored interactions.

#### Features
1. Facial Detection: The system detects faces in images or live video streams using computer vision techniques.
2. Facial Recognition: Once faces are detected, the system recognizes known individuals by comparing their facial features with a database of known faces.
3. Integration with Home Automation Systems: Explore opportunities for integrating the facial recognition system with home automation platforms such as Raspberry Pi-based smart home setups or popular IoT frameworks.

#### Working Procedure
1. Face Detection: The system uses computer vision algorithms to detect faces in images or live video streams captured by a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Face Encoding: Detected faces are encoded into numerical representations called face embeddings, which capture unique features of each face.
3. Face Recognition: The system compares the face embeddings of detected faces with a database of known face embeddings to recognize individuals.
4. Integration with Home Automation: Upon recognizing a known individual, the system triggers predefined actions within the home automation setup, such as adjusting lighting, temperature, or accessing personalized preferences.
